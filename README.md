# Codex Usage for Windows

A small, native Windows tray app for one job: keeping your OpenAI Codex usage visible.

It is intentionally Codex-only. There are no provider plugins, browser-cookie imports, API-key forms, or unrelated dashboards.

## Features

- Supersampled, anti-aliased system-tray meter with an original six-lobed contour showing the least available Codex quota window; a fresh window is `100` and fully filled.
- Compact popup with available percentages for the 5-hour and weekly windows, reset countdowns, plan, and credits when available.
- Persistent 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day, and 90-day history charts, with per-point hover details, reset markers, and a usage forecast that projects to zero or the next reset, opened from the tray's right-click menu. Forecasts that exhaust quota early include their lead time; safer forecasts show the expected quota remaining at reset.
- Activity-aware forecasts learn the local hours when quota has historically decreased and exclude observed off hours from the pace. An hour counts as active only when consumption recurs there on at least 10% of the days it was observed, so an occasional late night does not become a permanent active hour. The checkbox switches between flat off-hour segments on a uniform time axis and an active-time view that collapses those intervals. A gap bounded by equal quota readings is treated as assumed flat time (including overnight); otherwise, the forecast falls back to elapsed time until all 24 clock hours have evidence.
- Local Codex token totals for the selected chart period, the current primary quota window since reset, and today. They load in the background with a progress indicator; the reader parses only token counter events in local Codex session files, never conversation messages.
- Support for model-specific Codex limits returned by the service.
- Manual refresh plus configurable 1, 2, 5, 15, or 30 minute polling.
- Optional Windows notifications when available quota drops to 30%, 20%, 10%, or 0%.
- System, dark, and light themes.
- Optional per-user launch at sign-in; no administrator access required.
- Single-instance behavior with self-contained and smaller .NET-dependent single-file builds.

## How authentication works

Codex Usage reuses the ChatGPT sign-in already stored by Codex in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` (or `$env:CODEX_HOME\auth.json`). It never asks for or stores a password, API key, cookie, or copied token.

If the access token expires, the app uses the existing Codex refresh token and atomically updates the same auth file. It never writes credentials anywhere else and never logs token values. Network calls are limited to OpenAI's `chatgpt.com` usage service and `auth.openai.com` token service.

Use ChatGPT authentication rather than API-key authentication. OpenAI documents the supported Codex sign-in methods and the `codex login` flow in its [authentication guide](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/auth).

## Build and run

Prerequisites: Windows 10/11 and the .NET 10 SDK.

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\CodexUsage.App\CodexUsage.App.csproj
```

To create a self-contained executable that does not require .NET on the destination computer, run or double-click `build.bat`:

```batch
build.bat
artifacts\win-x64\CodexUsage.exe
```

For a much smaller single-file executable, use `build-small.bat` instead:

```batch
build-small.bat
artifacts\win-x64-framework-dependent\CodexUsage.exe
```

The smaller build requires the x64 .NET 10 Desktop Runtime on the destination computer. Both builds also write `CodexUsage.exe.sha256` beside the executable.

For Windows on ARM:

```batch
build.bat -Architecture arm64
build-small.bat -Architecture arm64
```

The equivalent PowerShell commands are `.\scripts\build.ps1` and `.\scripts\build.ps1 -FrameworkDependent`.

To install it for the current user and create a Start Menu shortcut:

```powershell
.\scripts\install.ps1
```

The install script copies the app to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\CodexUsage`. Enable launch at sign-in from the tray menu or Settings.

"Start with Windows" applies at the next full Windows sign-in or reboot; locking and unlocking the current session does not rerun startup apps. Windows may also delay `Run`-key applications briefly after sign-in.

## Test

The tests use no third-party packages:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\tests\CodexUsage.Tests\CodexUsage.Tests.csproj
```

An opt-in live check reads the local Codex login, calls OpenAI once, and prints only the plan and quota percentages:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\tests\CodexUsage.Tests\CodexUsage.Tests.csproj -- --live
```

## Privacy and limitations

- Settings are stored in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexUsage\settings.json`; no secrets are stored there.
- Usage history is stored locally in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexUsage\history.jsonl`. Flat duplicate readings are compressed, and history is limited to 90 days and 50,000 samples.
- Token totals are best-effort sums of the counters emitted in local `%CODEX_HOME%\sessions` and `archived_sessions` files. They include model-processing tokens such as cached context and non-visible output, so they do not map one-to-one to quota percentage and may be unavailable when local session counters are absent.
- This is an independent, unofficial utility and is not affiliated with or endorsed by OpenAI.
- Local release builds are unsigned, so Windows SmartScreen may show an unrecognized-app warning. Verify the adjacent SHA-256 file before running a distributed copy.
- The tray app follows the behavior of CodexBar's OAuth usage source. The underlying ChatGPT usage route is not a public, versioned API and may change; parser and endpoint updates may occasionally be necessary.
- If only API-key authentication is configured, the app asks you to sign in with ChatGPT because ChatGPT plan quotas are separate from API billing limits.
