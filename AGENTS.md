# Repository agent instructions

These instructions apply to the entire repository.

## Pull-request ownership

- Only the user may merge pull requests.
- Agents must never merge a pull request, enable auto-merge, or bypass the merge handoff.
- After a pull request is open and its required checks pass, report that it is ready and wait for the user to merge it.
- Do not push directly to `main`. Branch from the latest `origin/main`, keep the pull-request branch free of merge commits, and let the required CI checks finish.
- If later work depends on a pull request, continue only after the user confirms that they merged it; then fetch and fast-forward local `main` before proceeding.

## Fast project discovery

1. Run `git status --short --branch` and preserve unrelated or pre-existing changes.
2. Read `README.md`, `Directory.Build.props`, the relevant project file, and the matching CI/build script before editing.
3. Use `rg`/`rg --files` when available; on Windows without ripgrep, use `git grep`, `Get-ChildItem`, and `Select-String`.
4. Follow the execution path from `src/CodexUsage.App/Program.cs` into `TrayApplicationContext`, then into the relevant UI or Core service. Keep business logic in Core where it can be tested without paint code.
5. Look for an existing regression test in `tests/CodexUsage.Tests/Program.cs` before designing a new abstraction.

## Repository map

- `src/CodexUsage.Core/` contains reusable logic with no WinForms dependency:
  - `Authentication/`: reads and refreshes the existing Codex ChatGPT credentials.
  - `Networking/`, `Parsing/`, `Models/`, and `Services/`: fetch and normalize usage responses.
  - `History/`: history samples, persistence, reset detection, schedule inference, and forecasts.
  - `Tokens/`: best-effort local token-counter aggregation.
  - `Formatting/`: user-facing labels shared by the app.
- `src/CodexUsage.App/` is the .NET 10 Windows Forms tray application:
  - `TrayApplicationContext.cs` owns refresh, notifications, menus, and window lifetime.
  - `UI/PopupForm.cs` is the compact tray popup.
  - `UI/HistoryForm.cs` and `UI/UsageHistoryChart.cs` own history presentation.
  - `UI/PreviewRenderer.cs` renders deterministic documentation and QA images.
  - `Settings/` owns local settings and Windows startup integration.
- `tests/CodexUsage.Tests/` is a custom STA console test harness, not xUnit/NUnit/MSTest. Add the test method and invoke it from `Main`; the printed assertion count should increase.
- `scripts/build.ps1` creates single-file release binaries and adjacent SHA-256 files. `build.bat` and `build-small.bat` are wrappers.
- `screenshots/` contains tracked README images. `artifacts/`, `bin/`, and `obj/` are generated and ignored.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines the required linear-history, formatting, and Windows build/test checks.

## Core behavioral invariants

- Store and display quota as available percent. Clamp untrusted service values, preserve fractional values, and use reported window durations/reset times instead of assuming fixed primary/secondary window names.
- Use `DateTimeOffset` for instants and explicit `TimeZoneInfo` for local-hour behavior. Cover DST/time-zone-sensitive changes with deterministic zones where possible.
- History persistence is best effort: a damaged JSONL line or write failure must not prevent usage refresh. Preserve legacy sample deserialization when adding fields, 90-day retention, the sample cap, and flat-sample compaction.
- Forecast pace is based on consumption since the current reported reset. When earlier history of the same window duration spans at least one full window, its pace is blended in as prior evidence worth one seventh of the window's active time, so a single busy session early in a window does not dominate. A learned schedule excludes observed off hours; until all 24 local hours have evidence, or when the schedule cannot explain current-window consumption, retain the wall-clock fallback.
- Equal quota readings around a long gap establish flat time. A long gap containing consumption is ambiguous and must not classify every intervening hour as active.
- Risky forecasts end at projected zero and show their lead time before reset. Safe forecasts end at the next reset and show projected quota remaining. Use `UsageDepletionForecast.ProjectionEndsAt` consistently for chart bounds, drawing, labels, and collapsed-axis calculations.
- Token totals parse counter events only. Do not read, log, test with, or expose conversation text.
- Network, file scanning, and token aggregation must not block the WinForms UI thread. Preserve cancellation and stale-result protection when changing background work.

## WinForms quality bar

- The app is Windows-only, targets `net10.0-windows`, uses `AutoScaleMode.Dpi`, and handles per-monitor DPI changes. Keep manual layout calculations valid at the minimum window size and non-100% DPI.
- Route all colors through `ThemePalette`; verify dark, light, and system themes for new controls or states.
- Update `LayoutContent`, theme application, visibility/enabled state, and disposal together when adding controls or owned resources.
- Keep the tray app single-instance and avoid activating or showing hidden preview/test forms on the user's desktop.
- For visual changes, render the relevant preview, inspect the PNG, and update the tracked screenshot when documentation would otherwise become stale. Useful commands after a Release build include:

```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\CodexUsage.App\CodexUsage.App.csproj -c Release -- --render-preview .\artifacts\popup.png
dotnet run --project .\src\CodexUsage.App\CodexUsage.App.csproj -c Release -- --render-history .\artifacts\history.png
dotnet run --project .\src\CodexUsage.App\CodexUsage.App.csproj -c Release -- --render-icon=75 .\artifacts\icon.png
```

Use synthetic data in committed tests and previews. Local `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CodexUsage\history.jsonl` may help reproduce a user-reported bug, but never commit personal history or session data.

## Required verification

On a fresh checkout, restore first. Before handing off a code pull request, run the same gates as CI:

```powershell
dotnet restore CodexUsage.sln
dotnet format CodexUsage.sln --verify-no-changes --no-restore
dotnet build CodexUsage.sln -c Release --no-restore
dotnet run --project .\tests\CodexUsage.Tests\CodexUsage.Tests.csproj -c Release --no-build
```

- Treat warnings as failures; nullable and deterministic builds are enabled repository-wide.
- Run the smallest relevant check during iteration, then the complete sequence before push.
- The opt-in `--live` test reads the real local Codex login and performs a network call. Run it only when the user explicitly requests live verification; never include its credentials or raw response in output.
- After pushing, watch all required GitHub checks. Report failures with the failing job and cause; report success and wait for the user to merge.

## Release procedure

- The application version is in `src/CodexUsage.App/CodexUsage.App.csproj`. Version changes go through a pull request that only the user merges.
- Tag and package only from a clean, user-merged `main` that exactly matches `origin/main`. Never tag a release branch or an unmerged commit.
- Run the required verification, then build all four packages:

```powershell
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Architecture x64
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Architecture x64 -FrameworkDependent
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Architecture arm64
.\scripts\build.ps1 -Architecture arm64 -FrameworkDependent
```

- Publish self-contained and framework-dependent x64/ARM64 executables named `CodexUsage-vX.Y.Z-win-*.exe`, each adjacent `.sha256`, plus `SHA256SUMS.txt`.
- Recompute checksums after final renaming and verify every asset against them before tagging or upload.
- Use an annotated `vX.Y.Z` tag on the merged release commit and release title `Codex Usage vX.Y.Z`. Notes must distinguish self-contained downloads from builds requiring the matching .NET 10 Desktop Runtime and mention that binaries are unsigned.
- Verify the published tag target, asset names/sizes/digests, release status, and clean local/remote branch state before reporting completion.

## Security and privacy

- Never print, log, commit, or expose access tokens, refresh tokens, API keys, cookies, auth-file contents, or session conversation content.
- Authentication must continue to reuse Codex's ChatGPT login and atomically update only the existing auth file. Do not add alternate credential stores or broaden network destinations without explicit user direction.
- Settings must remain secret-free. Keep local history and token scans best effort and local-only.
